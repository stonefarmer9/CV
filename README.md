## Georges Le Vaillant
{ George Le Valiant - british pronunciation}

I am nothing special, simply someone who wants to change their life to support a future unattainable through my previous choices. I have achieved a modest amount of success in the hotel industry, rising to dizzying heights of senior management, but now seek to change my prospects to provide a decent contribution to society and our people. Deciding that technology is where the true future of our societies development lies I wish to enter this industry to provide a service that will affect many positively and achieve an inner peace no longer offered to me.

These taught me the basics of the language and testing with Jest. I then pushed that process by rebuilding the first weekend project - Airport - in Javascript. The program demonstrates the process driven changes I have been through since the first week and the difference in the two code bases, test bases and commit histories exhibit these changes the most.|Javascript|Jest|5 mornings (09:00-13:00)|

## Skills

#### People

Through my time in hotels one skill mattered most and it was how you handled people. While not a natural skill entering the trade, it has certainly become one on leaving it. I have developed through years of customer service and working in teams a good ability to read a person and take steps to be someone who can work with them or provide an excellent experience for them. My skills with people eventually led to me to Accor Hotels professions challenge, a competition to find the worlds best hoteliers. Working towards it I eventually came away with an award for best Receptionist in the UK, going onto to represent the UK at an international competition.

#### Communication

The first thing to kill a hotel is a lack of communication, was advice given to me by one of my first managers. I only fully understood this upon reaching management level, where a lack of communication turned a complaint about a damaged car to a corporote level fandango.
I have become a dutiful and diligent communicator from my time in this industry, implementing numerous methods for my teams and the wider company to communicate better. A big part of this was the simple introduction of publicly available technology like whattsapp and gdrive to ensure everyone was in the know at all times, along with handling the wider hotel's Duty Manager log, I became the man in the know most days and nexus of communication around the hotel.

#### Creativity

I consider myself to be creative at heart and love the written word above any other art form. I have long hobbied as a crestive writer, conjuring enitre worlds into existence before snuffing them out. I try to bring this creativity to everything I do, be it creatively changing a cigarette break into a daily managers meeting, or applying totally new approaches to problems. I feel this skill affords me n ability to easily throw out the old and bring in the new as all stories must evolve to be eternal.

#### Patient

I have always been patient with people, and progression. I feel it is one of my greatest strength and by far the one that has taken me furthest. It is an undeniable asset in me that has allowed me to take underperforming staff, and in a few months of hard work turn them into team leaders and supervisors. I take the time to listen to those who follow me and to lead them down a path they are happy with, I will always wait and pick them up when they stumble as all people do, and I will never leave a man behind because they are slow, I would rather re-work the team to make them fast.

#### Team leadership

Having been a fervent follower of Simon Sinek's teachings since my exposure to it at a leadership training weekend. I followed his words and the words of some fantastic teachers based in the netherlands, and defined myself not as a manager but as a leader, someone who would lead the forlorn hope rather than direct it. I lived these values at my time in Windsor especially, even becoming the in house leadership trainer, allowing me to coach and teach the lessons that made me effective as people leader. It is really my aspiration to become a team leader or dare I say it, manager within technology as I believe my skills will truly shine in these roles eventually.


## Education & Qualifiations

#### Makers Academy (October 2017 - March 2018)

I have spent the last 16 weeks in developer boot-camp. The first four weeks of which are spent self-teaching in your home environment, followed by 12 weeks onsite at the academy. Here our learning was focused on the language agnostic skills needed to be a developer. The core teachings they provided me are:

- Object Oriented Design (OOD)
- Debugging process
- General methodical processes for approaching any project.
- SOLID principles such as Do Not Repeat yourself (DRY) and Single responsibility principle(SRP)
- Clean code conventions and processes.

The course has given me an excellent set of skills to enable me to become a junior developer and begin a career in the tech industry.

#### Hobbies & Interest ####
I have always loved to read, and write fiction, currently working on a fantasy epic while also working on a H.P. Lovecraft anthology novel with my partner who also writes.
I am an avid hiker, sometimes loving nothing more than to disappear into the country side with my boots, compass and notebooks seeking inspiration.
I am also a lover of interactive story-telling and gaming, requiring an awful lot of organisation and people managing but incredibly rewarding when your story takes your players through a good few loops.
