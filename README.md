A developer with a background in hospitality. I pride myself on my interpersonal skills, my creativity and my past success in leadership. Having completed an intense industry bootcamp I have learnt of and love the tenets of clean code and test driven development. Now at the end of my first year in the industry with two successful projects under my belt and a third ongoing I am looking forward to taking the next step in my personal and career development.

### Key Design Skills

 - _Test Driven development_ - TDD - I am experienced with: RSpec, Capybara, Jest, Enzyme, Jasmine - I believe in the tenets of test driven development and strongly believe it makes my code better.

 - _Object-Oriented-Design_ - OOD

 - _SOLID principles_: Don't repeat yourself (DRY), Single responsibility principle (SRP) and other clean code practices were the main areas of focus for this set of principles, I am excited to learn how much more SOLID has to offer.

 - _Process driven methodology_ - Makers instilled in me an understanding that with a good, solid process you can overcome any problem, bug or technology. A key tenet of their teachings is to perfect process, and while I feel perfection is far off I am driven to achieve this.



### Skills

- _People_ - My experience in hotels has given me a suite of skills to work with people and create a cohesive, supportive, and caring environment around me. My experience makes me a conscious pair partner and someone who wants to work with a team solve problems and deliver fantastic products together.

- _Communication_ - I have worked in the past to keep communication open and continuous. Utilising simple tools such as WhattsApp, GDrive and shared spreadsheets. I am focused on making sure everyone knows what is happening at all times as I know from experience how a simple break down can snowball to an avalanche of problems.

- _Creativity_ - Having long ridden the hobby horse of creative writer I consider myself to be creative at heart. I long for inspiration and it comes from the people around me. Everyone around me has a tale to tell and I want to hear it. This gives me an openness and curiosity to learn from those around me.

- _Patience_ - I have always been patient, and my hotel years have tested this thoroughly. I will never rush my work and aim for a "measure twice, cut once" attitude to everything I do. This trait means I make sure I know what it is I am doing before I take the first steps of progress.

- _Team Leadership_ - Having been a fervent follower of [Simon Sinek's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA&list=FLS9PFx7DUC7LOAII8mrArkw&index=8&t=0s) teachings since my exposure to it. I was trained to not be a manager, but a leader. I will always aim to work with people and help them, I want to help develop them and make them what they want to be, and lead them down a path of fulfilment.


## Education & Qualifiations

#### Makers Academy (October 2017 - March 2018)

I have spent 16 weeks in a developer boot-camp. The first four weeks of which are spent self-teaching in your home environment, followed by 12 weeks onsite at the academy. Here our learning was focused on the language agnostic skills needed to be a developer. The core teachings they provided me are:

- TDD
- OOD
- Debugging process
- General methodical processes for approaching any project.
- SOLID: DRY & SRP.
- Clean code conventions and processes.

The course has given me an excellent set of skills to enable me to become a junior developer and begin a career in the tech industry.

#### University of Durham (October 2008 - June 2011)

    BSc Honours Applied Psychology

#### Any other qualifications

```
A-levels :

#### Hobbies & Interest ####
I have always loved to read, and write fiction, currently working on a [fantasy epic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PUuP8AwBn2UY2svVBM5e8csOQf1CNxPyTvvl32xe3d4/edit?usp=sharing)(beware its a first draft!) while also working on a H.P. Lovecraft inspired anthology novel with my partner who also writes.
I am an avid hiker, sometimes loving nothing more than to disappear into the country side with my boots, compass and notebooks seeking inspiration.
I am also a lover of interactive story-telling and gaming, requiring an awful lot of organisation and people managing but incredibly rewarding when my players deduce my challenges and creatively work through my campaign.

Thank you for reading.
